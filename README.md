# Rescue Relay
- It's an open-source, crowdsourced software for catastrophe reporting where local residents can share information when emergency services publish disasters. Following analysis of data, our app will advise the departments on the best course of action.

## How to see UI sheet
- You can see UI sheet by opening `RescueRelayUI.excalidraw` on [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com) website.
