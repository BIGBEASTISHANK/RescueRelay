# Rescue Relay

## Short Description
- It's an open-source, crowdsourced software for catastrophe reporting where local residents can share information when emergency services publish disasters. Following analysis of data, our app will advise the departments on the best course of action.

---

## Brief Description
- **Rescue Relay** connects local volunteers with emergency services in real-time during disasters. Volunteers report on the situation, while emergency services (hosts) use the platform to coordinate and take action. The AI system helps hosts by summarizing data from volunteer reports and recommending the best course of action based on the emergency type. The system optimizes communication and decision-making, ensuring faster and more efficient responses.

## Core Features
- **Volunteer & Host Pages**: Different pages for volunteers and hosts to ensure smooth interaction.
- **Host Panel**: All emergency services act as hosts. Hosts can register, post updates, and receive AI-powered recommendations.
- **AI Implementation**: The AI system is implemented only in the host's account to analyze reports and suggest appropriate actions.
- **Push Notifications**: Users within a 5km radius of a disaster receive push notifications to stay informed and assist if needed.

## Volunteer Page
- Posts organized by distance: 
  - Within 5km, 5-10km, 10-15km, beyond 15km.
  - Each post will display the specific distance from the volunteerâ€™s current position.
- **Real-time Chat**: Volunteers upload text and images to share information on conditions like rescue status and traffic.
- **Historical View**: Volunteers can access a history of disasters they've helped with in their account section.
- **Local Government ID**: Volunteers can log in using their local government ID for verification.

## Hosts Panel
- **Host Registration**: Emergency services can register as hosts by providing their field (e.g., Fire Department) and operating area, along with a valid government ID.
- **Post & Close Disasters**: Hosts can create posts for new disasters and close them once resolved.
- **AI-Powered Summarization**: Hosts can view all chat messages and use the AI system to summarize the conversations. The system will check the host's department and recommend the next steps.
