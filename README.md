# Rescue Relay

The purpose of Rescue Relay is to facilitate rapid coordination and efficient response during emergencies, such as road mishaps or natural disasters. By enabling emergency services to receive real-time information and updates, and involving nearby residents and commuters, the platform optimises rescue operations and reduces chaos at the incident site. The software ensures emergency services can act quickly while civilians are kept informed, promoting safety and awareness.
